This standalone app returns some Pokemon lookup data.

### How To Use
1. On a Windows machine, [download the latest build](https://github.com/AntSkilton/PokeDexter/releases/download/release/PokeDexter_Release_0.1.7z), and unzip it. You may need 7Zip to unzip it.
2. Run `PokeDexterApp.exe`. If UAC pops up, select "More Info" and then "Run Anyway".
3. Enter any Pokemon name or it's number in the search bar to find some information about it.

These is search validation, and there's an easter egg if you fail an input on the first try.

If this was a for a production project, I would consider a different frontend implementation such as Blazor which doesn't require the user to download a new client everytime new client changes are made.
